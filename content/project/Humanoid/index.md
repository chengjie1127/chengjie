- Utilized MuJoCo for robot simulation, converting SolidWorks drawings to XML files.
- Implemented NMPC using OCS2 for solving optimization problems with multiple shooting methods.
- Applied WBC as a QP problem, solved using qpOASES solver.
- Employed a linear Kalman filter for torso state estimation and a PD controller for stable control.
- Achieved dynamic walking control of a 12-DOF bipedal humanoid robot in MuJoCo.
